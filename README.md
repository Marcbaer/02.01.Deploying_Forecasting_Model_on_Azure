# 02.01.Deploying_Forecasting_Model_on_Azure

This experiment trains an LSTM for forecasting the two dimensional Lotka-Volterra System. 
The predictions are then propagated *n* steps into the future.

The model is finally deployed on MS Azure using the Azure ML Software Developement Toolkit.

*02.01 Lotka Volterra System*
The Lotka Volterra equations are a system of two differential equations that describe the dynamics of a predator and a pray population.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \ = \delta xy - \gamma y">
Where $x$ represents the total number of preys, $y$ the number of predators and $\alpha,\beta,\delta, \gamma$ are parameters describing the interaction of the two populations.

The equations are integrated over 400 time steps and the results are ploted below:
